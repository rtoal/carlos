# Carlos

Carlos is a simple scripting language with a modern feel. It was created as an example language for a Compiler Construction class: it's simple enough to be implementable in a semester, not not too simple to be uninteresting.

Check out the [language specification](https://cs.lmu.edu/~ray/notes/carlos/), and notes on [how the compiler was built](https://cs.lmu.edu/~ray/notes/howtowriteacompiler/).
