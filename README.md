# Carlos

Carlos is a simple scripting language with a modern feel. It was created as an example language for a Compiler Construction class: it's simple enough to be implementable in a semester, not not too simple to be uninteresting.

Check out the [language specification](https://cs.lmu.edu/~ray/notes/carlos/), and notes on [how the compiler was built](https://cs.lmu.edu/~ray/notes/howtowriteacompiler/).

The compiler front-end was crafted with the help of [Ohm](https://ohmlang.github.io/) and the backend is a simple hand-written translation from the semantic graph to JavaScript. A nice future enhancement would be to target LLVM.
